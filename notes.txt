day 1
basic grid layout, custom vs extend?  surfaces ontop. 
rect prism renderable, create a grid of those in place of the surface.

day 2
flip patterns
sizing
listeneers on each prism, 
flip and stuff on click.  

behind these tiles, are other buttons.  
cubes, with sides.  tilting to different sides shows different buttons.  
pressing buttons depresses it, and its reboundaction causes things to flip.  

variable screen size?  maybe i can flip some of the cubes and turn them into part of the screen?  
monospace font.
